# Sentinel-1 System Changelog

## Milestone 1: System Pivot - Email Automation to Application Acceleration (Oct 8-9, 2025)
THE INTEGRITY CHECK BREAKTHROUGH

Recognized overengineering: 32+ tests, email automation, follow-up scheduling added complexity without employment value.

PIVOTED TO: Fast application generation using database-driven document creation with zero-defect methodology.

Impact: Refocused system on core value - getting applications submitted faster while maintaining Fortune 50 quality standards.

## Milestone 2: Experience Correction - Claims to Compliance (Oct 9, 2025)
THE ACCURACY MANDATE

Discovered application generator used INCORRECT experience narrative (healthcare claims data processing).

CORRECTED TO: Accurate Humana experience from Gold Standard resumes - Medicare Compliance Business Analyst with 9 years regulatory expertise. True experience: e-Commerce Acceleration projects (zero defects), Data Modernization, Annual Enrollment Period coordination, SQL data validation, CMS regulatory compliance.

Impact: All applications (Cedar TAM, Brown-Forman EA) now use verified accurate experience positioning.

## Milestone 3: Career Positioning Discovery - AI Governance Focus (Oct 9, 2025)
THE STRATEGIC REPOSITIONING

Identified optimal career path: AI Governance/Compliance roles ($120-180k) vs pure ML Engineer (skills gap too large).

STRATEGY: Position 9 years Medicare compliance as AI governance expertise. Regulatory translation, risk assessment, zero-defect testing, audit management = scarce AI governance skillset.

Market validation: 640 AI governance jobs at $139-204k annually. EU AI Act, CMS AI guidance, state laws driving explosive demand.

Created: AI governance application generator, interview strategy document, certification roadmap.

Impact: Clear competitive advantage targeting emerging field where regulatory compliance expertise commands premium and supply is limited.
