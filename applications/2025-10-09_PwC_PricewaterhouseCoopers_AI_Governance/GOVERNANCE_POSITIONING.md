# AI GOVERNANCE ROLE APPLICATION - Job #75

Company: PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers)
Title: Data & Analytics Engineer - AI/ML
Salary: $100k-$145k
Location: Remote (Louisville office option)

POSITIONING STRATEGY:

You are NOT applying as:
❌ ML Engineer (skills gap too large)
❌ Data Scientist (need PhD/MS + advanced stats)
❌ AI Developer (need coding expertise)

You ARE applying as:
✅ AI GOVERNANCE SPECIALIST
✅ Compliance expert who ensures AI is deployable in regulated environments
✅ The person who prevents $50M regulatory violations

INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS:

Opening ("Why AI?"):
"After 9 years managing Medicare compliance affecting 300,000 members, I've watched organizations deploy AI without the governance infrastructure healthcare spent decades building. With the EU AI Act, state laws, and upcoming CMS AI guidance, companies need people who can translate regulations into compliance frameworks. That's my expertise."

Skills Gap ("Do you code?"):
"I'm learning Python and ML fundamentals, but my role isn't building models - it's ensuring they're compliant, auditable, and safe. I translate technical capabilities into regulatory risk assessments. I design testing frameworks for bias detection. I build audit trails for regulatory examinations. That's the scarce skillset in AI governance."

Value Prop ("What do you bring?"):
"9 years achieving 100% on-time delivery of CMS submissions with zero compliance violations. I know how to coordinate across Legal, IT, and Operations on governance. I led projects with zero defects through systematic testing. When healthcare AI faces its first major regulatory enforcement action, organizations will need people like me who understand both the technology and the compliance requirements."

CERTIFICATION TALKING POINTS:

"I'm completing AI Governance, Ethics & Risk certification this month and IBM AI Ethics certificate. I'm also evaluating CGEIT for 2026. I'm committed to continuous learning while contributing immediately through governance expertise that can't be built overnight."

BEFORE SUBMITTING:
1. Add certifications to resume: AI Governance (In Progress - Nov 2025)
2. Replace [COMPANY NAME] in cover letter
3. Research if company has healthcare AI practice (emphasize regulatory expertise)
4. If consulting firm (PwC, Deloitte), emphasize cross-functional coordination

SUBMIT WHEN:
Role explicitly mentions: Governance, Compliance, Risk, Ethics, Audit, Regulatory
OR: Healthcare AI implementation (where compliance is critical)
