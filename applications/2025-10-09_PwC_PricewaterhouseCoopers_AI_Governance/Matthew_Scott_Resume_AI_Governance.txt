WHY AI GOVERNANCE:

The AI governance crisis is acute: Organizations deploy AI systems lacking the compliance infrastructure healthcare spent decades building. My 9 years managing Medicare compliance at Fortune 50 scale provides exactly what AI governance requires:

• Zero-Defect Validation: Testing protocols ensuring compliant system implementation

• Audit Readiness: Building documentation trails for regulatory examinations

I'm not pivoting from compliance to AI - I'm bringing compliance expertise to an AI field that desperately needs it. My value isn't coding models; it's ensuring those models are safe, compliant, and audit-ready from conception through deployment.
