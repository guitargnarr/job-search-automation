• Agile/SDLC Methodology: Participated in sprint planning, managed user stories and technical requirements, coordinated UAT, and ensured successful deployment across enterprise systems

WHY BROWN-FORMAN:

As a Louisville resident, I have deep appreciation for Brown-Forman's legacy and commitment to our community. Your premium spirits portfolio - from Woodford Reserve to Old Forester - represents craftsmanship and quality that aligns with my approach to project management: attention to detail, systematic execution, and commitment to excellence.

I'm particularly drawn to Brown-Forman's digital transformation initiatives and the opportunity to lead projects that blend technology implementation with business process optimization across a global enterprise.

My 9 years managing enterprise projects at Fortune 50 scale, combined with my local presence and immediate availability, positions me to contribute from day one to Brown-Forman's strategic initiatives.

My salary expectations align with the $95k-$125k range (or Glassdoor's $74k-$113k if that's more current) for this senior PM role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my enterprise project management experience can support Brown-Forman's continued growth and innovation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Matthew David Scott
