Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Strategic Solutions Analyst position at Waystar. With 9 years serving as a technical liaison between business stakeholders and IT teams at Humana (Fortune 50), managing strategic client relationships, and providing analytical support for healthcare payment systems, I am confident I can excel as a trusted advisor to Waystar's most strategic clients and partners.

• Ability to translate complex healthcare concepts for diverse audiences - technical and non-technical stakeholders

ANALYTICAL SUPPORT & TECHNICAL SKILLS:

WHY WAYSTAR:

Waystar's mission to simplify healthcare payments through innovative technology resonates deeply with my background. At Humana, I experienced the complexity of healthcare billing and payment workflows firsthand. Waystar's platform - streamlining revenue cycle for providers and connecting payers seamlessly - addresses critical pain points I understand intimately.

As a Strategic Solutions Analyst, I would bring:
• Immediate healthcare domain credibility with strategic provider and payer clients
