Hiring Manager
Celsius Holdings
Louisville, KY

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Print Project Manager position at Celsius. With 9 years managing complex, deadline-driven projects at Humana (Fortune 50) - coordinating cross-functional teams, managing vendor relationships, and delivering 100% on-time performance on critical initiatives - I am excited to apply my project management expertise to Celsius's dynamic consumer goods environment.

While my background is in healthcare rather than print production, the core project management competencies this role requires are exactly what I've honed over 9 years:

PROJECT MANAGEMENT & TIMELINE COORDINATION:

• Led Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) projects at Humana - our highest-stakes period requiring meticulous timeline management, cross-functional coordination, and flawless execution with zero tolerance for delays

• Managed e-Commerce Acceleration and Data Modernization projects coordinating 15+ team members across IT, Creative, Legal, and Operations - similar cross-functional dynamics to Creative/Brand/Operations coordination

• Achieved 100% on-time delivery for 100+ time-sensitive projects over 9 consecutive years - demonstrating the deadline-driven performance and organizational excellence this role demands

• Coordinated multiple concurrent projects with competing priorities, establishing timelines and managing resources - directly applicable to managing multiple print/packaging projects simultaneously

STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT & COMMUNICATION:

• Trafficked deliverables between business stakeholders and technical teams, gathering approvals from senior leadership and ensuring aligned execution - parallels artwork trafficking and stakeholder approval processes

• Communicated status updates, progress, and roadblocks to executive leadership and cross-functional partners - same communication flow needed for production leads and brand teams

• Built trusted relationships across Creative (web design), Legal (compliance review), IT (technical implementation), and Operations teams - preparing me to partner effectively with Creative, Brand, and Operations at Celsius

VENDOR COORDINATION & DOCUMENTATION:

• Managed third-party vendor relationships and audit processes requiring detailed documentation, timeline coordination, and specification tracking

• Created and maintained detailed project documentation, tracking systems, and compliance records - directly applicable to maintaining production calendars, asset trackers, and art code systems

• Monitored compliance needs in partnership with Regulatory and Legal teams - relevant to packaging compliance monitoring requirements

ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE & FAST-PACED EXECUTION:

• Thrived in fast-paced, high-pressure environment where delays could affect millions of members and millions in revenue

• Strong attention to detail ensuring zero defects on critical projects affecting enterprise platforms

• Self-starter and quick learner - successfully mastered complex Medicare regulations, enterprise systems, and technical workflows; committed to rapidly learning print production processes and packaging development

TECHNICAL PROFICIENCY & TOOLS:

• Project management tools: JIRA, SharePoint for documentation and tracking (ready to learn Asana/Smartsheet)
• Microsoft Office expert: Excel (tracking), PowerPoint (presentations), Word (documentation)
• Comfortable with technical workflows and pre-press concepts (eager to develop expertise in print/packaging workflows)

WHY CELSIUS:

Celsius's culture of innovation, fast-paced growth, and ownership mindset resonates deeply. As a Louisville resident, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic consumer brand while staying local. The combination of project management rigor with creative energy appeals to my systematic approach and eagerness to work in a collaborative, fast-moving environment.

I bring immediate value through proven project management fundamentals - timeline coordination, stakeholder alignment, vendor management, and flawless deadline execution. While I'll be learning print production specifics, my track record of rapidly mastering new domains (complex Medicare regulations, technical systems) demonstrates I can quickly become proficient in print/packaging workflows while contributing immediately through organizational excellence.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my project management experience can support Celsius's print and packaging initiatives.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Matthew David Scott
