## YOUR DEFENSE STRATEGY

**Before Applying:**

1. **Google yourself:** See what employers will find
2. **Social media audit:**
   - Set all to private except LinkedIn
   - Remove controversial posts
   - Untag inappropriate photos
3. **Online reputation:** Claim your name on platforms
4. **Privacy settings:** Lock down Facebook, Instagram

**During Application:**

1. **LinkedIn optimization:** Complete profile, professional photo, no controversial content
2. **Disable location:** Don't let LinkedIn show "Louisville, KY" if applying to remote jobs elsewhere
3. **Email address:** Professional (matthewdscott7@ not partyguy420@)
4. **Phone number:** Google Voice if privacy concerned

**Interview Phase:**

1. **Assume surveillance:** They've seen your social media
2. **Consistency:** Your story must match online footprint
3. **Professionalism:** Everything you say may be checked

**Red Flags Employers Look For:**
- Illegal activity mentions
- Discriminatory statements
- Bad-mouthing previous employers
- Inconsistencies (resume vs. LinkedIn)
- Unprofessional photos/content

**What's Protected:**
- Religion, political views (can't reject based on these)
- Health conditions (ADA protections)
- Union activity
- Whistleblowing

**What's Fair Game:**
- Professionalism assessment
- Culture fit
- Public statements about work ethic
- Skills verification
