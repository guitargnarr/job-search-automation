## TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"I'm not getting any responses"**
**Solutions**:
1. Review resume versions - are they ATS-friendly? (Use keywords from job postings)
2. Improve cover letter personalization (spend more time on Tier 1)
3. Apply earlier (fresh postings get more attention)
4. Broaden search (apply to adjacent roles: operations analyst, business analyst, data coordinator)

### **"I can't find 10-15 jobs per day"**
**Solutions**:
1. Expand geographic search (remote roles nationwide)
2. Expand role types (healthcare analyst, compliance analyst, operations analyst)
3. Check company career pages directly (Norton Healthcare, Baptist Health, etc.)
4. Set up job alerts on LinkedIn/Indeed for daily emails

### **"Applications take too long"**
**Solutions**:
1. Pre-fill common application questions in a doc (work history, references, etc.)
2. Use more Tier 3 applications (3-5 min each)
3. Batch similar applications (all healthcare roles at once using Resume A)
4. Save cover letters as templates for faster customization

### **"I'm unsure if I'm qualified"**
**Solution**:
- Use Skills Translation Guide
- If you meet 60%+ requirements → APPLY
- If under 60% → SKIP or address gaps honestly in cover letter
