## COMPETENCY #9: AI/QUALITY EVALUATION (For AI Training Analyst Roles)

### **Resume Claim**:
"9+ years quality evaluation experience: pattern recognition, error detection, validation, and iterative refinement"

### **Why This Maps to AI Training**:

**Traditional AI Model Training**:
- Evaluate AI outputs for accuracy → **Same as**: Evaluate website outputs for compliance
- Identify patterns in errors → **Same as**: Identify patterns in defects across releases
- Design test scenarios → **Same as**: Design test cases for web properties
- Validate against expected criteria → **Same as**: Validate against CMS guidelines
- Provide feedback for improvement → **Same as**: Report defects for developer resolution
- Iterate based on data → **Same as**: Refine testing based on analytics

**Specific Example (Interview-Ready)**:
> **Situation**: Testing new chatbot feature on Medicare website. Bot was supposed to help members find plans based on their needs, but early testing showed inconsistent answers.
>
> **Task**: Evaluate chatbot quality, identify error patterns, provide actionable feedback to improve accuracy.
>
> **Action**: Created 50 test scenarios covering common member questions. Tested each scenario 3 times to check consistency. Documented errors by category: (1) Factual inaccuracies (bot cited wrong premium), (2) Regulatory language errors (bot used non-CMS-approved terms), (3) Logic errors (bot recommended plan member wasn't eligible for), (4) UX errors (bot gave confusing response). Identified pattern: bot performed well on straightforward questions but failed on multi-variable scenarios (member in specific ZIP + specific age + specific condition). Provided developers with exact examples, expected outputs, and suggested improvement: enhance training data to include more multi-variable scenarios.
>
> **Result**: Developer team enhanced bot training data based on my categorized feedback. Chatbot accuracy improved from 68% to 94% on multi-variable questions. My systematic evaluation approach became standard for all future AI feature testing.

## WHEN THEY ASK: "WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU?"

### **Your 60-Second Answer**:

"I bring three things that make me uniquely valuable for this role:

**First**: Nine years of quality evaluation experience where I've designed test scenarios, identified error patterns, and validated outputs against strict criteria—which is exactly what [AI training / healthcare analytics / data analysis] requires.

**Second**: Deep healthcare domain expertise as a Medicare compliance SME. I understand CMS regulations, healthcare data sensitivity, and the stakeholder landscape—knowledge you can't learn in a bootcamp.

**Third**: Proven ability to work cross-functionally. At Fortune 50 scale, I've built trusted relationships across IT, Legal, Regulatory, and executive leadership. I know how to translate technical requirements for business audiences and regulatory constraints for technical teams.

The specific example that shows all three: [Pick the most relevant STAR story from above based on their role].

I'm confident I can contribute immediately because these aren't theoretical skills—I've been applying them for 15 years."

---

## WHEN THEY ASK: "WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS?"

### **Your Authentic Answer** (With Growth Narrative):

"I'd say my biggest area for growth is **expanding my technical toolkit**. For 9 years, I've worked primarily with SQL for data validation and analytics. I've been incredibly effective with it—I can write complex queries, troubleshoot data discrepancies, and use SQL to drive business decisions.

But I recognize that in roles involving advanced analytics or AI, proficiency in Python or R opens up additional capabilities. That's actually one reason I'm excited about this role—[if it involves learning: I'd have opportunity to expand my technical skills while contributing my domain expertise and analytical thinking / if it values current skills: it leverages my SQL expertise and analytical approach without requiring skills I'm still developing].

I'm a fast learner—when I joined Humana, I had basic SQL knowledge and within 6 months was writing complex joins across multiple tables to solve production issues. I approach new tools the same way: hands-on practice solving real problems.

So while Python/R is an area I'm growing in, my 9 years of data-driven problem-solving, SQL proficiency, and analytical mindset mean I can contribute value immediately while expanding my technical capabilities."

**Why this works**:
- Honest (not fabricated weakness)
- Shows self-awareness
- Demonstrates growth mindset
- Connects to role
- Ends on strength

---

## WHEN THEY ASK: "WHY ARE YOU LEAVING HUMANA?"

### **Your Authentic Answer** (Positive, Forward-Looking):

"I've had a great 9 years at Humana. I've grown from Risk Management Analyst to Senior Risk Management Professional, become the Medicare compliance SME, and led projects like e-Commerce Acceleration with zero critical defects.

But after 9 years in the same role, I'm ready for new challenges. Specifically, I'm excited about [AI's potential to transform healthcare / using my healthcare expertise in analytics-driven roles / applying my data skills in new domains].

What attracts me to this role is [specific aspect of their job: the opportunity to work directly with AI model training / the chance to apply healthcare analytics at Norton / the combination of stakeholder management and technical work]. It feels like the natural evolution of what I've been doing—taking my quality evaluation skills, my data analysis capabilities, and my stakeholder management experience and applying them in [AI/analytics/new context].

I'm looking for a role where I can contribute immediately with my Medicare compliance expertise and SQL skills, while also growing in [AI capabilities / advanced analytics / strategic leadership]—and this position offers exactly that combination."

**Why this works**:
- Positive about Humana (no negativity)
- Clear career progression narrative
- Shows intentionality (not desperate)
- Connects past experience to future role
- Enthusiastic about their opportunity
