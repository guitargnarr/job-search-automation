## INTERVIEW PREPARATION: Translating Your Experience

### When they ask: "Tell me about your experience with data analysis"

**Don't say**: "I do QA testing and check if things work"

**Do say**: "I've spent 9 years conducting data analysis using SQL to validate customer and application data, identify trends, and drive business decisions. For example, I developed an analytics-based testing approach at Humana that targeted the highest-impact customer segments, and I produce monthly executive reports that distill complex data into actionable insights.

---

### When they ask: "Do you have AI experience?"

**Don't say**: "No, I've never worked with AI"

**Do say**: "While I haven't built AI models, I have extensive experience in the quality evaluation work that's central to AI training. For 9 years, I've been designing test scenarios, identifying patterns in errors, validating system outputs against expected criteria, and providing detailed feedback for improvement—which is exactly what AI model evaluation requires. The systematic, detail-oriented approach I've applied to quality assurance translates directly to evaluating AI outputs, and I'm excited to apply those skills specifically to AI systems."

---

### When they ask: "What's your experience with healthcare data?"

**Don't say**: "I work on a website"

**Do say**: "I've spent 9 years as a Medicare compliance subject matter expert at Humana, which means I work with healthcare data daily in a highly regulated environment. I validate customer data using SQL, ensure compliance with CMS regulations, coordinate with Regulatory & Compliance teams, and understand the unique challenges of healthcare data—HIPAA constraints, regulatory reporting requirements, and the critical importance of accuracy when data impacts patient care or federal compliance."
