Hiring Manager
Brown-Forman Corporation
Louisville, KY

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Project Manager - EPMO position at Brown-Forman. As a Louisville native with 9 years of enterprise project management experience at Humana (Fortune 50), I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to one of Kentucky's most iconic companies while leading strategic technology and business process initiatives.

My qualifications align exceptionally well with your EPMO methodology and cross-functional leadership requirements:

ENTERPRISE PROJECT MANAGEMENT (9 Years at Humana):

• Led e-Commerce Acceleration and Data Modernization Projects: Managed cross-functional teams of 15+ members across IT, Business, Legal, and Operations, achieving ZERO critical or high defects through systematic project governance and stakeholder coordination

• Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) Orchestration: Coordinated Humana's highest-revenue period ($20B+), managing technical dependencies, integration timelines, and alignment across multiple business units and technology teams - similar scope and complexity to Brown-Forman's enterprise initiatives

• Delivered 100+ Time-Sensitive Projects: Achieved 100% on-time delivery as directly responsible individual (DRI) for critical regulatory and business deliverables over 9 consecutive years

• Agile/SDLC Methodology: Participated in sprint planning, managed user stories and technical requirements, coordinated UAT, and ensured successful deployment across enterprise systems

CROSS-FUNCTIONAL LEADERSHIP & STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT:

• Built trusted relationships across IT engineering, business operations, legal, regulatory, and compliance teams at Fortune 50 enterprise scale

• Translated between technical and business stakeholders, ensuring alignment on project objectives, timelines, and deliverables

• Presented project status, risk assessments, and strategic recommendations to senior leadership and executive stakeholders

• Managed vendor relationships and third-party integrations requiring technical coordination and contract management

TECHNICAL ACUMEN & BUSINESS PROCESS EXPERTISE:

• SQL & Data Analysis: Expert proficiency in SQL for project metrics, data validation, and reporting
• Enterprise Tools: JIRA (project tracking), SharePoint (documentation), Oracle, Braze, Firebase, Splunk
• Technical Documentation: Created detailed project plans, process workflows, integration specifications
• Risk Management: Identified and mitigated project risks, developed contingency plans, managed issue escalation

PROJECT DELIVERY EXCELLENCE:

• Zero-defect track record through systematic governance, rigorous testing protocols, and proactive risk management
• Managed projects ranging from 3-month tactical initiatives to 18-month strategic transformations
• Coordinated resources across distributed teams, managed conflicting priorities, and delivered under budget
• Built executive scorecards tracking project health, milestones, and key performance indicators

WHY BROWN-FORMAN:

As a Louisville resident, I have deep appreciation for Brown-Forman's legacy and commitment to our community. Your premium spirits portfolio - from Woodford Reserve to Old Forester - represents craftsmanship and quality that aligns with my approach to project management: attention to detail, systematic execution, and commitment to excellence.

I'm particularly drawn to Brown-Forman's digital transformation initiatives and the opportunity to lead projects that blend technology implementation with business process optimization across a global enterprise.

My 9 years managing enterprise projects at Fortune 50 scale, combined with my local presence and immediate availability, positions me to contribute from day one to Brown-Forman's strategic initiatives.

My salary expectations align with the $95k-$125k range (or Glassdoor's $74k-$113k if that's more current) for this senior PM role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my enterprise project management experience can support Brown-Forman's continued growth and innovation.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Matthew David Scott
